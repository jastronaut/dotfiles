### simple x hotkey daemon configuration

i made this mostly so that if someone *has* to use my computer for me, they have something to vaguely guide them.

most of the commands to start things utilize the `super` key because i'm most familiar with it.

also some of the keybinds might be really weird, especially the function key things. (i attempted to base them off of my keyboard... which didn't work). also picture below related: my keyboard
